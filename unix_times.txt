%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
  -> this seems it was introduced in ext4.
     ? when unavailable.
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
  -> atime: when you accessed the file even for reading (head, cat... )
%Y     time of last modification, seconds since Epoch
  -> mtime: data was added or removed from file
%Z     time of last change, seconds since Epoch
  -> ctime (inode change): Changes even if metadata changes


Notice the posibility of having weird values for these variables when
your underlying storage device is a network device.
